New App Onboarding / On-prem Application Migration To Cloud Environment (AWS)

Onboarding a new app or migrating an on-prem application to AWS cloud environment requires a ServiceNow CRM (Cyber Risk Management) ticket submission. The Security Operation team (SOC) and the Initial Risk Assessment (IRA) team will receive a task ticket.

The SOC team conducts an architecture review/cybersecurity app discovery, cloud accreditations (cloud console configuration audit) and, arranges pen-tests, exception, or code scanning if needed.

If the platform or app team that submitted the ticket involves/utilizes a vendor solution, the team and the vendor will need to work with the Third-Party CRM team to receive security approval.

The IRA team sends out an IRA (Initial Risk Assessment) and a Detailed Risk Assessment (DRA) if they determine that it is required after reviewing the IRA. 

Application deployment on-prem would not require going through the cloud accreditations process.

Lastly, final approval will be determined after all security team have completed all security check and in a cases where an exception is needed the platform/app team would have to work with ?

Cybersecurity Risk Management (CSRM) Process:

The Architecture review / Cybersecurity App discovery is the process of reviewing the security posture prior to migration and ensuring all security best practices are being followed. A Solution Architectural Diagram (SAD), if any, would be reviewed by the security team to ensure the security concerns are noted and addressed before deploying any infrastructure in the cloud environment.

General info:
•	The review is done prior to building the cloud infrastructure.
•	Typically, the review is done in one meeting (30mins - 1hrs)

What's needed:
•	Submit a ServiceNow ticket to initiate the CSRM process.
•	Arch diagram (SAD) that shows components/services/resources that would be deployed.
•	Cloud account ID: usually a 12-digit number

To schedule/setup the call:
•	The Cloud Security team will need at least 1 week to prepare for the call.

The turnaround time:
•	The review is 1-2 hours.
•	After that, the app team will need to remediate the findings brought up by the Cloud Security team.


The Cloud Security Accreditation is a process performed by Cloud security where the Production cloud console/environment configurations are reviewed to ensure security best practices.

General info:
•	The review is done in the production cloud environment.
•	All of the resources/infrastructure will need to be stood up in prod for the review.
•	Typically, the review is done in one meeting (1-2hrs)

What's needed:
•	Completed Prod environment with all of the resources/infrastructure stood up
•	Arch diagram that shows deployed components
•	Prod cloud account ID: usually a 12-digit number
•	The final go-live date.

To schedule/setup the call:
•	The Cloud Security team will need at least 1 week to prepare for the call.

The turnaround time:
•	The review is 1-2 hours.
•	After that, the app team will need to remediate the findings brought up by the Cloud Security team.

The MPT (Manuel Penetration Test) is a process where the Application Security team completes a penetration test to check the security posture of the application. It is targeted to Staging/ Pre-Prod/QA environments.

General info:
•	The MPT must be performed against a code complete (pre-prod) environment prior to the app being used in production.
•	Testing is done in the Staging / Pre-Prod environment.

What's needed:
•	MPT ServiceNow Request or a request through SOC team.
•	Completed Staging / Pre-Prod environment.
•	Credentials for each permission group (User vs Administrator).

The turnaround time:
•	TBD

DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) is a testing process where the Application Security team assess a web application through the front-end to find vulnerabilities through simulated attacks.

How to Request:
•	TBD
Requirements are:
•	TBD
The turnaround time:
•	TBD
