Giving this instance, what are the pros and cons for option 1 and 2? 
option 1: You can clone the policies and modify the RQL by adding the filter "AND grantedby.cloud.entity.name NOT IN ('test1', 'test2', 'test3')" to create custom policies of your own, disable the existing OOTB policy, and update the Alert Rule to include these new custom policies. This would mean you'd have to create and update any other policies that you do not want these assets to be alerted on.

option 2: You can add a tag to these assets on AWS, add a Tag resource list under settings, and then create/modify the alert rule to auto-dismiss any alerts that match this tag. This would mean the alerts still get generated, but auto-dismissed as soon as they do. 

Option 1: Clone Policies and Filter via RQL 

Pros:
Granular control: excluding only what’s truly needed.
No alert generation: Prisma won't generate alerts for the excluded roles
Prevents clutter: Reduces noise at the source, not after the fact.
Aligns well with governance: Maintains visibility and policy alignment with CIS/NIST/etc. without hiding real risk.

Cons:
High management overhead: You must clone and maintain each relevant policy.
Risk of missed updates:	Palo Alto’s OOTB policy updates (unless you re-sync regularly).
Alert Rule complexity: You need to update your alert rules to use the new clones (e.g., for all cloud types).

Option 2: Tag Assets or resources
Pros:
Fast and scalable: Once the tag and rule are in place, it applies to all alerts.
No policy maintenance: Palo Alto’s updates to OOTB policies wont be missed.
Automation: Easier to implement in dynamic environments (CloudFormation, Terraform etc)

Cons:
Alerts still generate: Adds audit clutter.
Auto-dismiss: This may hide future risk if not properly reviewed.
Requires tagging discipline: Tagging must be enforced consistently.
Dismissed alerts may confuse auditors:	Large numbers of dismissed alerts could appear to be ignored or misprioritized if not well documented.

Objective: "Secure FunaFlex cloud infrastructure by enforcing governance and compliance standards for clear security visibility in Prisma CSPM. Coordinate with the IBM team to evaluate or update configurations, policies and rule sets. Monitor and triage security findings to define false positive, operational requirements, dismissal, snooze, exception, exclusion or escalate to engineering and app teams for remediation, thereby reducing FunaFlex overall risk."

Status: "IAM (user or role) "progressive", Anomaly "progressive", Attack Path "progressive", Audit Event "progressive", Config "progressive", Network "progressive", Compliance Standard "progressive""

Risk: Vulnerability exploitation​, Misconfiguration, Data loss or exfiltration​, Resource Hijacking, Impact to operations​, High Privilege role, Alignment with groups/teams in ITSM for easy identification of responsibility, Internet Exposure and Privilege Escalation

ChatGPT update

Objective

Establish and maintain continuous security governance across FunaFlex’s cloud infrastructure using Prisma Cloud CSPM.
Ensure visibility, compliance, and risk reduction by:

⦁	Enforcing cloud security best practices and compliance standards (e.g., CIS Controls v8.1).
⦁	Coordinating with the IBM Cloud Operations team to evaluate and update configurations, custom policies, and alert rule sets.
⦁	Continuously monitoring and triaging CSPM alerts to identify false positives, operational requirements, and legitimate risks.
⦁	Applying appropriate alert handling actions: dismissal, snooze, exception, or exclusion, and escalating high-risk findings to engineering and application owners for remediation.

The ultimate goal is to reduce *** overall cloud security risk while supporting operational efficiency and audit readiness.

.........................
Current Posture / Status

• IAM (User/Role): Progressive – Monitoring Control Tower roles with scoped policies
• Anomaly Detection: Progressive – Reviewing unusual behavior and API activity
• Attack Paths: Progressive – Exposure graphs under review for high-privilege chaining
• Audit Events: Progressive – Logs exported via alert rules and APIs
• Configuration: Progressive – Ongoing misconfiguration assessment
• Network Exposure: Progressive – Triaging internet-exposed assets
• Compliance Standards: Progressive – Aligned with CIS v8.1; reviewed monthly

.........................
Key Risk Areas Identified

⦁	Cloud Misconfigurations: Non-compliant resources (e.g., public storage buckets, overly permissive IAM roles).
⦁	Vulnerability Exploitation: Unpatched container images or third-party libraries detected during scans.
⦁	Data Loss or Exfiltration: Risks due to exposed services or lack of encryption.
⦁	Privilege Escalation: IAM roles/users with excessive permissions, including potential admin path chaining.
⦁	Resource Hijacking: Detection of unauthorized usage (e.g., crypto mining or misuse of compute).
⦁	Operational Disruption: Unplanned changes or shadow IT resources affecting service integrity.
⦁	Lack of Accountability Mapping: Gaps in aligning alert ownership with ITSM teams and business units.
⦁	Internet Exposure: Publicly accessible cloud assets (e.g., EC2, RDS, S3) without proper controls.
